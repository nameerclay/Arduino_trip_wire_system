# Arduino_trip_wire_system
 A tripwire laser system is a device triggered by physical movements, you can use it to detect people, animals, car and ring the buzzer when they pass through the laser.
 I have built it using arduino uno micro-controller
 Future scope -- It will alert the user via mobile sms and emails
